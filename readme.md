## Struct2GO:protein function prediction based on Graph pooling algorithm and AlphaFold2 structure information
## Abstract
Struct2GO is a protein function prediction model based on self-attention graph pooling, which utilizes structural information from AlphaFold2 to augment the accuracy and generality of the model's predictions.
